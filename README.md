A simple math quiz written in C.

There are currently 4 difficulty levels, all levels will use operands +, -, / and *:

1. Operands are less than 10.
2. Oprands are less than 100.
3. One operand is substituted with 'x' and the answer is shown. (find x)
4. One operand is substituted with 'x', the operator is unkown and the answer is shown. (find 'x' and input the missing operand)
5. Squares where base is a less than 10.

In multiplication, the second operand will always be less than 10 (single digit).
In division, the answer will always be an integer.
both of the above were done to limit the overall difficulty of the quiz.

This was written with the basics I've learned in C to date.
